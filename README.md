## SLOGAN  
collective intelligence to design AI solutions  

## PARADIGM  
The collective intelligence is the greatest force for progress...  

## 21 RULES  

1- club of friends. our group, our union is the most important thing  
2- trust each other is the core of our relationships  
3- developing of projects, programs, code, mathematical modeling, formulas, etc...  
4- experimentation, fail, proof, write, debug, execute, codify is the soul of our business  
5- fail is not problem, make be free to experiment  
6- experiment and think outside of the box  
7- focused in our interests  
8- learn, learn, learn and comunicate to others  
9- it's not mandatory have final products, but the main goal is achieve this  
10- improving, improving, retroalimentation and many many feedbacks  
11- horizontal communication... no budy is better than other, all us are learning  
12- critics don't exist... feedbacks and insights to improving, yes this exists!  
13- feel be freedom to express your ideas, don't exist bad ideas, don't exist dumbs ideas  
14- passion and entusiast is mandatory required  
15- make and show things you are interested and passionate about it  
16- everything is shared  
17- everyone supports each other, if someone needs your help and you can help this  
    person, feel free to help this person  
18- it's an informal club... there are rules but we are free thinking  
19- not egos, not competition, our business is the learning, creation of
    solutions and experimentation  
20- don't be shy, share anything that you have in your mind...all ideas are welcome :)  
21- and finnally, here we don't have fuck*** deadlines :)  

## GOALS  

1) Emulate the process of Research & Development (R&D)  
   of the most successful companies  
2) Feel free to improve our technical skills -> hard skills  
3) Take as basis the things that university teach us...  
   to learn and do things for which they did not teach us     
4) Create good solutions, code, programs and systems  
5) establish good friendships  
6) improve our abilities to comunicate our ideas and explain  
   our projects - hard + soft skills  
7) design and implementation of practical solutions for real problems

### STRATEGIC PLAN  

1) In short-time  

- Make reality this club, define very well the mechanisms and times for  
the meetings and technical contents  

- Grow and incorporate new entusiastic members  

- Improve technical skills of all members  

- Each member of club will be able to present short/large technical implementations  

2) In large-time  

- Socialize and communicate good final projects developed in our club,  
  in events from Polytech like FabLab events  

- That our group is a hotspot for the generation of new ideas and projects  

3) Mision  

- Using our collective intelligence, make real one collective project   
  under the authorship of our club and present a purposal of real solutions  
  for a real industry problems to an important and renowned economic forum  
  like:  
  * San Petersburg International Economic Forum  
  * International Municipal BRICS+ Forum  
    or in any other event or place in San Petersburg/Moscow  
    where there are business + tech and trading opportunities  

   reasons:  
	* we have the tallent  
	* we have the people  
	* we have the information  
	* we have the motivation  

4) Vision   

- Artificial Intelligence have the power to solve many problems with  
  reasonable levels of complexity in industries like: financial markets,  
  energy, medical, education, e-comerce. AI in sinergy with our baggage  
  of knowledge and adopting the collective intelligence paradigm  
  will empower us in our hard and soft skills to solve the problems  
  that reality demand of us.  


### MECHANISM AND DYNAMIC OF THE MEETINGS  

1) Time  

Organized in 1 or 2 times x month, the meetings will be defined under accordance,  
generally in weekends or in holidays, in times which all members can assist  
and have disponibility  

2) Mechanism   

 1. Our meetings are conversations and demostrations or discusions about some topic  
    or about some specific project, or program.  

 2. Our presentations are straight to the point. Logic of problem + code of solution  

 3. Sometimes, theory and foundamentals will be necessary discuss...  
    let's go build our theory in blackboard and formulate all from scratch  

 4. Non-formal meetings, not mandatory make ppts, pdfs, etc... all theoretical  
    information was need, go straight to the books and make own formulations  
    The most important thing is find a friendly way to communicate our ideas.  
    For that GitHub repository is the best instrument for communicate and  
    share our ideas  

 5. All development is incremental. Take the start point ideas, and improve  
    step by step, meeting by meeting and finally in some moment,   
    we will have some final program or system. Patience here is required.  

 6. Our model of thinking is not like university, it's like startups   
    We will take the knowledge from academy to generate real solutions for real problems  
    of industry  

 7. Explore and make experimentation on topics that are at the vanguard of  
     computer science and related with our own interests and passions
